		<h4>PROBLEM</h4>
		<p>In their day to day lives, tenants face a number of problems which are related to the apartments that they live in. The idea was to design an interactive solution that would overcome the drawbacks of the current procedure followed to report and resolve these problems and also help simplify it.</p>

		<h3>PROBLEM SCOPING</h3>
		<hr>
		<div class="col-md-4">
		<p>After identifying the problem space I started enlisting drawbacks within the process currently being followed in order to help me decide its scope and start thinking about solution alternatives</p>

		<h3>SOLUTION IDEAS</h3>
		<hr>
		<div class="col-md-4">
		<p>After the initial phase, I came up with 6 possible solutions that could be used/ were being used to solve the current issues. Out of these I narrowed down on selecting the alternative of designing a mobile application to solve the problem in question.The reasons for selecting a mobile phone as a medium were as follows: 
		</br><br>- Easy integration with the camera to report issues
		</br><br>- Push notification services could be leveraged for inspection appointments and reminders</p>

		<h3>USER SURVEY</h3>

		<div class="col-md-4">
		<p>After narrowing down to a solution, I sent out a survey to potential users to get an idea if the initial solution would work and understand the problem space better.</p>

		<h3>COMPETETIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
		<hr>
		<div class="col-md-4">
		<p>In the competitive analysis it was found that although the different apps in the same domain cover different features , there is an overall problem regarding the focus of the application.

		The applications focus on a wide variety of features and their placement isn't really well done. 

		Quick navigation to the maintenance section is seen to be missing in most of the applications and there needs to be better integration with actual scheduling of appointments for addressing maintenance requests.</p>

		<h3>USER INTERVIEWS AND PERSONAS</h3>

		<div class="col-md-4">

		<h3>BRAINSTORMING</h3>
		<hr>
		<div class="col-md-4">
		<p>I had a brainstorming session with three other peers during which I realized that the scope of my application was getting too broad. 

		I was trying to include too many features in order to increase the frequency of use of the application.

		I decided to focus on Issue Tracking & Accountability features within the application</p>

		<h3>QOC'S</h3>

		<h3>WIREFRAMING</h3>
		<hr>
		<div class="col-md-3">
		<p>Based on the QOC's model, I sketched wireframes for the application.After identifying "tracking" as the key feature of the application, I created three flows for the same.</p>

		<h3>USABILITY TESTING</h3>
		<hr>
		<div class="col-md-4">
		<p>After creating the paper prototype, I conducted a usability test of the paper prototype on graduate students in the University of Michigan. The feedback received made me realize that my prototype was aesthetically appealing but not very usable. I got feedback from my peers and decided to re-design the layout of the information to make it simple and easy to use.</p>

		<h3>DIGITAL PROTOTYPE</h3>
		<hr>
		<div class="col-md-12">
		<p>After a couple of rounds of feedback on the new design, I created the digital prototype of my application using Illustrator and Invision.The design was done using Android material UI. 

Following mock ups depicts the home screen of the application. It is a quick overview of all the currently open issues along with what stage they are in currently.Users get appointment notifications on the home screen and can quickly accept or reschedule them.</p>

		<img class="col-md-6 col-xs-12" src="imgs/mine-02.png">
		<p>Another important feature of the application was the tracking of any given issue. It was a place where the user could find all the activity related to the issue.It also provided a mechanism to update the issue with any more data if required.</p>

		<h3>LEARNINGS</h3>
		<hr>
		<div class="col-md-12">
		<p>- One of the major learnings of the entire process was sticking to one feature of the application at a time and build upon it iteratively and incrementally.</br></br>

- The second major learning was to take feedback in all the stages. Some of the most helpful insights I received was from the feedback received during the length of the process.</p>
